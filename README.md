# Personal Portfolio Assignment

**Assignment Instructions**

- Create your own GitHub profile/ID (use a name appropriate for job applications) <https://happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html>
- Once you have a Github account, sign up for an account at <https://app.netlify.com/signup> and log in using your Github account
- Create a new public repo for your portfolio website & initialize it with a "readme" file.
- Turn your repo into a default website, using the steps outlined in <https://github.com/kostis-christodoulou/am01/blob/master/website/setting_up_portfolio_website.md>
       - modify content if you like, but for now it's fine to use the theme content provided and just change your name, email address, etc.
- Locate class repo
    - Find "kostis-christodoulou" in GitHub and locate the "github-practice-am01-2022" repo
    - Click on "README.md" >> Edit (pencil icon in upper right)
- **Add a row** in the table below with your information, using the first row as a remplate
    - Name, Study Group, and Github ID, url for Github Repo for portfolio website, and portfolio website address 
    - **commit** your changes and submit **pull** request   
            - write a **descriptive** commit message (e.g. "added Kostis Christodoulou to class table")  
            - click green button "Propose file change" & start pull request  
    - make sure the link works (e.g., wrap url in "<" and ">" to activate link on actual website)  
    - **Important**: Your entry will NOT appear on the class table right away.  Once you submit the "pull request" the owner of the repo (me) needs to approve and merge it into the "master" before your entry will appear in the class table on the website.
